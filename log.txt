decided to start a dedicated log
started work on a "pokedex" to store information for pokemon like stat details so they can be called upon in the code
ran into some trouble with getting astropy tables to let me store a numpy array in the table
found a work around but i don't like it
debating whether or not a like representing the pokemon types as numbers, especially directly to the player
but the numbers are very convenient for coding like...
bruh idk

4 october 2020
hello. added contact details for all the moves and updated the movedex
about to add more pokemon to the pokedex and set the main code so that it prints the pokedex on start up
lit we love a log hello future people.

5 october 2020
forgot to update the log.
threw some pokemon in the pokedex (the kanto starters and johto box mascots)
added pokedex functionality to the main code so players can use preset stats and typings
9:10PM- uhh guess we're doing times now
added a type table along with the pokedex, easy to print, kinda pretty to look at, and probably convenient for coding idk i already had the strings in a list so the type index <-> type string relation was already there but i made the table ANYWAY so here we are
10:08PM- added recoil damage :P

6 october 2020
12:26AM- started working on revamping the battling, especially stat stages...but obstensibly...everything else as well

10 october 2020
6:54PM- paralyzed pokemon have speed cuts, burned pokemon take attack cuts, pokemon may be fully paralyzed 25% of time, need to fo posion, current no moves in the game cause poison so theres that
i may have also worked out stat stages in battle, the move side of that is less developed
ugh
11:36PM- big changes
rearranged the battle code so it works better, i think idk i didnt get to test it, its not finished yet
i think most of it should work it's only a matter of cleaning up the end of turn things like poison damage, burn damage, etc.
implementation of these things is still not yet there
it's getting there
oh you can set the opponent's pokemon team now i think

11 october 2020
1:57AM- okay finished up a solid amount of work and now it's definitely broken
so that's cool can't wait to have to fix that
10:32A- battling mostly works now, still some bugs around pokemon faint/switch in that need to be resolved
mostly committing rn so i can work on this on not my cell phone
2:32P- ended up not fixing the battle problems at all and instead worked on the move tutor, pokedex selection, pokemon screen, etc.
cleaning up the UI, usage of b AND B to go back, getting generally handier with try except else blocks
lets get it
fixed sandstorm giving boost to ghost type instead of rock type lmao
9:06P- you can save and load pokemon now cause yeah i'm that serious about this
11:08P- uhh refined loading save files to catch bad file paths and incorrectly structered save files

14 october 2020
8:45P- maybe fixed the battling system? Idk i instituted some checks so that pokemon fainting and switch and the like goes smoothly.
i only tested it a little but it seemed like i fixed some bugs
really the only way to really test this is to REALLY play it...it's getting pretty complex at this point, especially with the save files...like you can get invested in this
too many
10:16P- programmed in paralysis burn and poison, though currently no moves cause poison

16 october 2020
7:39P- kinda did the damn thing with PP

17 october 2020
4:19P- okay just did a lot lemme think:
struggle
stat stages
can't switch to a pokemon that's already battling
that might be it, it doesn't look like a lot written down but i promise you it was a lot
gonna do a couple commits because im worried i maybe broke it somewhere
10:21P- wanted to document somewhere that there is distinctly an issue where the game checks for poison/burn/etc. damage even if the pokemon was just switched in...
gotta fix that

21 october 2020
bruh
added flinching
started refining pokemon battle architecture, really no idea where it's headed
but changes are definitely due
building a little team for cynthia including new moves so that's fun
we'll probably set up some sort of trainer variable to hold the opponent's name
lit
4:47P- don't even remember what I did tbh
finished cynthia's team
battled a couple of times, everything seems to flow
it's nice
uhh i think the next addition to the battling should be a "status" option
since stat stages should in theory work now it'd be nice to actually see them in action
i'm thinking we can show the user their pokemon's augmented, effective stats and everything
#EXPOSED
idk we'll see
5:15P- okay removed old/obsolete files from depository
also i forgot to note in that last note that i added tools to reset your team and remove unwanted pokemon
need to also add functionality to change leading pokemon
5:43P- okay added changing lead pokemon
still working and b and B for back :(

22 october 2020
11:04A- gotta add renaming pokemon
4:04P- gotta add ability to set battle stage: weather, terrain, etc.

23 october 2020
3:07P- didnt do any of the things I listed just yesterday, but accuracy and evasion stats have been implemented
4:01P- i keep just adding things, not testing the code, forgetting what i changed, and then assuming everything works
that preface was so i could say i added sandstorm and hail damage
i think also some fixed some bugs in the battle code that went covertly unnoticed
bro why did gamefreak do all this and why does it slap
like they got everybody hooked on this to where i'm hooked on emulating it
well hope this works

24 october 2020
11:57A- added weather moves and changing weather
8:58P- high critical hit ratio moves are implemented

26 october 2020
9:15P- yo revamped status conditions so that i dont need a separate block of code for moves with different chances of causing the various things they caused
i kinda just stole the method i had already devised for the stat changes, and like it works so let's put it to work idk
still havent tested any of this of course, also kinda not done, need to fix how recoil and flinch are implemented
it's mostly busy work honestly i still need to reorder the battling mechanics
and implement all the different moves.....leech seed has been in the back of my mind for so long...
anyway here's a commit, a proof of concept if you will

27 october 2020
8:50A- fixed recoil and bug new statuses, np.argwhere works better when its checking a numpy array, rather than just a list
but otherwise checking a numpy array (with its determined data type) for particular strings elicits python feedback that id rather avoid in the middle of battle
the solution is to make the notes list a np array when we need to run it through argwhere, elsewise leave it a lowly list
no i did not test the code

28 october 2020
3:14P- pi time, nice
edited the todo list to reflect recent additions
small edits to moves.py
dk where we're headed rn tbh but we're def gonna get there
3:44P- noting for the record that crits are supposed to ignore stat nerfs of attacker and stat boosts of target
someone'll get around to fixing that I'm sure
4:00P- reworking damage function rn to fix the critical hits:
crits occur within damage() which only takes a few pokemon attributes, and NOT their stat changes, so those aren't available for use to calculate critical hit damage
so we're redoing damage() to take the two pokemon entirely, not just some attributes, hope it doesn't kill this code
4:30P- done redoing damage() i hope
realized there's some ambiguity as to when things should go in hit() and when they should go in move()
hit() is only ever called in the end of move(), so anything that happens after hit() in move might as well have been appended to hit(), right?
is the choice arbitrary? is one better than the other? i really don't know team
anyway it still works i did actually test it this time
well tackle works so damage() is functional but who knows about umm...everything else in pokemon
5:07P- finished editing the log...lol
6:42P- priority moves..
7:02P- battling was in fact broken, physical moves worked, specials didn't because the burn variable was never defined
anyway terrains are in
not all the things that terrains affect i.e. causing sleep/confusion, priority..........
8:10P- okay terrains are mostly implemented wherever i could find to implement them
no priority moves yet for psychic terrain to prevent,
ugh earthquake is already in the game i can add that
okay i'll do that soon i guess
still no moves that cause confusion, so nothing to cause confusion, so nowhere to set misty terrain to prevent confusion
but we'll get to that soon i guess as well
tired
11:55P- reworked battling all the way, might be broken idk it looks like charmanders hp isnt recalculating after taking sandstorm damage for some reason
we'll fix it later

29 october 2020
8:43A- another day, another log entry for me to go overboard for
I have work to do today, otherwise battling system is coming along well
need to check for either trainer blackout immediately after moves are used and not after end of turn damages and weather are prompted
so we'll check for that after moves, if it is the case that neither trainer has blackout out, we can run switch in, after end turn damages, and even without checking for blackout then
alright..

30 october 2020
7:16P- didn't do that other things about checking for blackouts right after the moves are used
instead implemented terrain moves
feel like I keep saying terrains are mostly done and then documenting how terrains were even further integrated
idk they really are mostly done now, disregarding the things that just aren't in the code yet
7:52P- did the thing i wrote about yesterday, works p well
also properly implemented status moves causing status conditions
guess we'll move on to confusion/freeze/sleep? still need to program those
ugh they all need counters, i really lost
9:10P- tried to add some new moves, went and started tweaking inflicting status conditions (via status moves, not damaging moves)
thinking it'll prob be easier to make these callable functions
anyway i didn't quite finish, tried testing it, after inflicting luxray with sleep (which has no functionality yet) i tried inflicting poison, and bulbasaur used the move and that was it nothing more happened, especially not a "luxray already has a status condition, which I was expecting
anyway I'm tired I'll be back later bye future people
9:20P- moves.py wont work in terminal, (even though) the main code works it just fine, whatever goodbye again

2 november 2020
3:32P- we love a hiatus
gonna idk fix statuses i guess
4:27P- fixed that thing from the last log, moves.py not working and luxray not being poisoned were related,
accidentally included an extra 2 in the poison powder info
BOI
