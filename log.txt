decided to start a dedicated log
started work on a "pokedex" to store information for pokemon like stat details so they can be called upon in the code
ran into some trouble with getting astropy tables to let me store a numpy array in the table
found a work around but i don't like it
debating whether or not a like representing the pokemon types as numbers, especially directly to the player
but the numbers are very convenient for coding like...
bruh idk

hello. added contact details for all the moves and updated the movedex
about to add more pokemon to the pokedex and set the main code so that it prints the pokedex on start up
lit we love a log hello future people.

5 october 2020
forgot to update the log.
threw some pokemon in the pokedex (the kanto starters and johto box mascots)
added pokedex functionality to the main code so players can use preset stats and typings
9:10PM- uhh guess we're doing times now
added a type table along with the pokedex, easy to print, kinda pretty to look at, and probably convenient for coding idk i already had the strings in a list so the type index <-> type string relation was already there but i made the table ANYWAY so here we are
10:08PM- added recoil damage :P

12:26AM- started working on revamping the battling, especially stat stages...but obstensibly...everything else as well

6:54PM- paralyzed pokemon have speed cuts, burned pokemon take attack cuts, pokemon may be fully paralyzed 25% of time, need to fo posion, current no moves in the game cause poison so theres that
i may have also worked out stat stages in battle, the move side of that is less developed
ugh
11:36PM- big changes
rearranged the battle code so it works better, i think idk i didnt get to test it, its not finished yet
i think most of it should work it's only a matter of cleaning up the end of turn things like poison damage, burn damage, etc.
implementation of these things is still not yet there
it's getting there
oh you can set the opponent's pokemon team now i think
