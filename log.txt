decided to start a dedicated log
started work on a "pokedex" to store information for pokemon like stat details so they can be called upon in the code
ran into some trouble with getting astropy tables to let me store a numpy array in the table
found a work around but i don't like it
debating whether or not a like representing the pokemon types as numbers, especially directly to the player
but the numbers are very convenient for coding like...
bruh idk

hello. added contact details for all the moves and updated the movedex
about to add more pokemon to the pokedex and set the main code so that it prints the pokedex on start up
lit we love a log hello future people.

forgot to update the log.
threw some pokemon in the pokedex (the kanto starters and johto box mascots)
added pokedex functionality to the main code so players can use preset stats and typings
9:10PM- uhh guess we're doing times now
added a type table along with the pokedex, easy to print, kinda pretty to look at, and probably convenient for coding idk i already had the strings in a list so the type index <-> type string relation was already there but i made the table ANYWAY so here we are
10:08PM- added recoil damage :P
