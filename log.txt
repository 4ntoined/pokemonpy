decided to start a dedicated log
started work on a "pokedex" to store information for pokemon like stat details so they can be called upon in the code
ran into some trouble with getting astropy tables to let me store a numpy array in the table
found a work around but i don't like it
debating whether or not a like representing the pokemon types as numbers, especially directly to the player
but the numbers are very convenient for coding like...
bruh idk

4 october 2020
hello. added contact details for all the moves and updated the movedex
about to add more pokemon to the pokedex and set the main code so that it prints the pokedex on start up
lit we love a log hello future people.

5 october 2020
forgot to update the log.
threw some pokemon in the pokedex (the kanto starters and johto box mascots)
added pokedex functionality to the main code so players can use preset stats and typings
9:10PM- uhh guess we're doing times now
added a type table along with the pokedex, easy to print, kinda pretty to look at, and probably convenient for coding idk i already had the strings in a list so the type index <-> type string relation was already there but i made the table ANYWAY so here we are
10:08PM- added recoil damage :P

12:26AM- started working on revamping the battling, especially stat stages...but obstensibly...everything else as well

10 october 2020
6:54PM- paralyzed pokemon have speed cuts, burned pokemon take attack cuts, pokemon may be fully paralyzed 25% of time, need to fo posion, current no moves in the game cause poison so theres that
i may have also worked out stat stages in battle, the move side of that is less developed
ugh
11:36PM- big changes
rearranged the battle code so it works better, i think idk i didnt get to test it, its not finished yet
i think most of it should work it's only a matter of cleaning up the end of turn things like poison damage, burn damage, etc.
implementation of these things is still not yet there
it's getting there
oh you can set the opponent's pokemon team now i think

11 october 2020
1:57AM- okay finished up a solid amount of work and now it's definitely broken
so that's cool can't wait to have to fix that
10:32A- battling mostly works now, still some bugs around pokemon faint/switch in that need to be resolved
mostly committing rn so i can work on this on not my cell phone
2:32P- ended up not fixing the battle problems at all and instead worked on the move tutor, pokedex selection, pokemon screen, etc.
cleaning up the UI, usage of b AND B to go back, getting generally handier with try except else blocks
lets get it
fixed sandstorm giving boost to ghost type instead of rock type lmao
9:06P- you can save and load pokemon now cause yeah i'm that serious about this
11:08P- uhh refined loading save files to catch bad file paths and incorrectly structered save files

14 october 2020
8:45P- maybe fixed the battling system? Idk i instituted some checks so that pokemon fainting and switch and the like goes smoothly.
i only tested it a little but it seemed like i fixed some bugs
really the only way to really test this is to REALLY play it...it's getting pretty complex at this point, especially with the save files...like you can get invested in this
too many
10:16P- programmed in paralysis burn and poison, though currently no moves cause poison

16 october 2020
7:39P- kinda did the damn thing with PP

17 october 2020
4:19P- okay just did a lot lemme think:
struggle
stat stages
can't switch to a pokemon that's already battling
that might be it, it doesn't look like a lot written down but i promise you it was a lot
gonna do a couple commits because im worried i maybe broke it somewhere
10:21P- wanted to document somewhere that there is distinctly an issue where the game checks for poison/burn/etc. damage even if the pokemon was just switched in...
gotta fix that

21 october 2020
bruh
added flinching
started refining pokemon battle architecture, really no idea where it's headed
but changes are definitely due
building a little team for cynthia including new moves so that's fun
we'll probably set up some sort of trainer variable to hold the opponent's name
lit
4:47P- don't even remember what I did tbh
finished cynthia's team
battled a couple of times, everything seems to flow
it's nice
uhh i think the next addition to the battling should be a "status" option
since stat stages should in theory work now it'd be nice to actually see them in action
i'm thinking we can show the user their pokemon's augmented, effective stats and everything
#EXPOSED
idk we'll see
5:15P- okay removed old/obsolete files from depository
also i forgot to note in that last note that i added tools to reset your team and remove unwanted pokemon
need to also add functionality to change leading pokemon
