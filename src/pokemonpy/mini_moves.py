# burn, para, sleep, frze, pois, badPois, conf - inflict status conditions
# flinch - chance to flinch
# recoil - move damages the user, sometimes based on damage done, sometimes as a proportion of max HP
# hex - move does double damage if the target has a status condition
# solar - 2-turn move that becomes 1 move in sunlight, has power halved in hail, sandstorm, and rain
# dance - moves the activate the dance ability
# moldbreaker - move ignores ability
# collision - move that does 4/3 damage if supereffective
# bullet - move is blocked by bulletproof
# highCrit - move has an increased critical hit ratio
# mustRest - the user will be forced to rest on the next turn
# 2turn - the user will attack on the next turn
# arrows - ground type move that can hit and will ground flying types
# gust - catches Fly-ing pokemon and does double damage
# thunder - catching Fly-ing pokemon and less accurate in sun
# thaws - thaws the user out of the frozen condition
# scald - a non-fire-type "hot" move, thaws the user and target
# pulse - move is boosted by mega launcher
# slicing - move is boosted by sharpness
# noMiss - bypasses accuracy check to always hit/unless the target is semi-invulnerable
# noMissRain - bypasses accuracy check in rain
# noMissPoisons - bypasses accuracy check when used by a Poison-type
# noTarg - does not target the opponent / does target the self
# revelation - move changes type to match the user's primary type
# blessing - recovery move deals 25% max HP
# refresh - heals status conditions

# range key, thank God for bulbapedia, I owe her my life
# 0 - hits 1 target (could be ally, in theory)
# 1 - hits 2 targets (has to be opponents i think)
# 2 - hits specifically an ally (beneficial usually)
# 3 - all but the user
# 4 - all on the field
# 5 - affects user
