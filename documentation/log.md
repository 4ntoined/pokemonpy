### v0.1.2
What all we might do:
* Earthquake being weakened by Grassy Terrain is not shown in damage readout.
* A config file. The game saves some settings and/or the user can fix and arrange some settings so that when the game runs, it does the things the config file tells it to do.
The user need not use -m everytime to mute the pregame, they can preset the gamewidth, their name, their preferred starter party size. 
* Set the battle UI (user's name and poke-health-info) to take up the full extent of the game width.
