### v0.1.2
What all we might do:
* Opponent name setting
* Earthquake being weakened by Grassy Terrain is not shown in damage readout.
* A config file. The game saves some settings and/or the user can fix and arrange some settings so that when the game runs, it does the things the config file tells it to do it.
The user need not use -m everytime to mute the pregame, they can preset the gamewidth, their name, their preferred starter party size.
