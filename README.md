# Anybody here play Pokémon?
Just me? That's fine.

This Python program simulates Pokémon and Pokémon battles. For a more detailed description of the game, check out documentation/game_blurb.md

### Prerequisites:
 - Python
 - Numpy

#### Start the game:
```python3 pokemon.py [-m] [-n your_name_here] [-w how_big_to_display_the_game] [-p number_of_starter_parties] [-s number_of_pokemon_per_party]
```

use '-m' to skip the game start-up


#### Edit the game:

The game is incomplete, an imperfect imitation of Pokemon by GameFreak, and is not completely bug-proof. But it works really well if you don't try to break it.

More stuff for the readme probably.
