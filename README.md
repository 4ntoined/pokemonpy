# Anybody here play Pokémon?
Just me? That's fine.

This Python program simulates Pokémon and Pokémon battles.
For a more detailed description of the game, check out [game_blurb.md](https://github.com/4ntoined/pokemonpy/blob/lead_dev/documentation/game_blurb.md)
For a demonstration of how to play the game, check out [this guy's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/0SFg-sSOZBY) (and like and comment and subscribe, he told me to tell you that).
The rest of the readme will be geared toward codestuff: prerequisites, launching the game, and modifying the code to your tastes, etc.

### Prerequisites:
 - Python
 - Numpy

### Start the game:
```python3 pokemon.py [-m] [-n your_name_here] [-w how_big_to_display_the_game] [-p number_of_starter_parties] [-s number_of_pokémon_per_party]```

all of these are optional inputs
- use '-m' to skip the game start-up
- use '-n' to set your name, you can set your name in-game, used to display in battles
- use '-w' to set the length of banners and headers throughout the game, defaults to 64 I think
- use '-p' to set the number of parties you start with
- use '-s' to set the number of Pokémon in each of those parties

#### Editing the game:



The game is incomplete, an imperfect imitation of Pokemon by GameFreak, and is not completely bug-proof. But it works really well if you don't try to break it.

More stuff for the readme probably.
