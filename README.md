# Pokemon.py

This Python program simulated Pokemon and Pokemon battles.

Prerequisites:
 - Python
 - Numpy

#### Start the game:
(Navigate to the 'pokemonpy' directory.)
python3 pokemon.py -m -n YOURNAME -w GAMEWIDTH -p NUMBEROFSTARTERPARTIES -s NUMBEROFPOKEMONPERPARTY

The game is incomplete, an imperfect imitation of Pokemon by GameFreak, and is not completely bug-proof. But it works really well if you don't try to break it.

More stuff for the readme probably.
